## 1. Overview

Azure Advisor provides personalized recommendations to optimize Azure resources for **cost**, **security**, **performance**, and **reliability**. This document focuses on **cost-saving opportunities** and proposes actionable steps for optimization.

## 2. Current Azure Resources Overview

| Resource Type          | Count | Current Tier / Size      | Monthly Cost Estimate |
|------------------------|-------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Virtual Machines (VMs) | 10    | Standard_D4s_v3         | $2,500              |
| Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) | 2 | Standard, 2-node clusters | $1,200              |
| SQL Databases          | 5     | General Purpose, 2 vCores | $1,000             |
| Storage Accounts       | 6     | Standard, Hot Tier      | $300                |
| App Services           | 4     | Standard S1             | $400                |

## 3. Azure Advisor Cost Recommendations

### 3.1 Right-size or Shutdown Underutilized VMs
- **Issue:** Some VMs are running at < 20% CPU/Memory utilization.
- **Recommendation:**  
  - Downsize VMs to smaller SKU (e.g., Standard_D4s_v3 → Standard_D2s_v3).  
  - Shut down non-critical development/test VMs when not in use.
- **Estimated Savings:** ~$500/month

### 3.2 Use Reserved Instances (RIs)
- **Issue:** VMs and SQL Databases are running as Pay-As-You-Go.
- **Recommendation:**  
  - Purchase 1-year or 3-year **Reserved Instances** for predictable workloads.  
  - Apply RIs to production VMs and databases.
- **Estimated Savings:** 30–40% over Pay-As-You-Go

### 3.3 Optimize Storage Accounts
- **Issue:** Some storage accounts have low access frequency but are using **Hot Tier**.
- **Recommendation:**  
  - Move infrequently accessed blobs to **Cool** or **Archive Tier**.  
  - Enable **Lifecycle Management** to automatically tier or delete old data.
- **Estimated Savings:** ~$50/month

### 3.4 Delete Unused Resources
- **Issue:** Old snapshots, unattached disks, and idle Public IPs detected.
- **Recommendation:**  
  - Delete unattached disks and old snapshots.  
  - Release unused public IPs.
- **Estimated Savings:** ~$100/month

### 3.5 Scale Down AKS Clusters
- **Issue:** AKS clusters running at low utilization.
- **Recommendation:**  
  - Enable **Cluster Autoscaler**.  
  - Reduce node count for development and testing clusters.  
  - Use spot instances for non-critical workloads.
- **Estimated Savings:** ~$300/month

### 3.6 Optimize App Services
- **Issue:** Some App Services are over-provisioned.
- **Recommendation:**  
  - Evaluate actual usage metrics and scale down the App Service Plan.  
  - Enable **Auto-Scale** to scale out/in based on demand.
- **Estimated Savings:** ~$100/month

## 4. Proposed Action Plan

| Action Item                                 | Resource Target       | Priority | Estimated Savings |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------|-----------------|
| Right-size underutilized VMs               | All underutilized VMs | High    | $500            |
| Purchase Reserved Instances                | Prod VMs & Databases | High    | 30–40%          |
| Tier Storage Accounts                       | Blob Storage         | Medium  | $50             |
| Delete idle disks, snapshots, and IPs      | VMs & Storage        | Medium  | $100            |
| Enable Cluster Autoscaler for AKS           | AKS Dev clusters     | High    | $300            |
| Optimize App Service Plans                  | App Services         | Medium  | $100            |

## 5. Summary

By implementing the above recommendations, the organization can reduce Azure costs by approximately **$1,050/month** plus additional savings through Reserved Instances (30–40%). Regular monitoring via **Azure Advisor** and **Cost Management + Billing** should be performed to track ongoing optimization opportunities.
