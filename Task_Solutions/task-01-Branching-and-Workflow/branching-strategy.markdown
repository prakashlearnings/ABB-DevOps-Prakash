# Branching Strategy

This document outlines a branching strategy for effective version control, collaboration, and code quality using Git. It covers branching, pull requests (PRs), and code reviews to ensure a streamlined development process.

## 1. Branching Model

We use a simplified Gitflow-inspired branching model to balance collaboration and stability.

### Main Branches
- **`main`**: The production-ready branch. Only stable, tested code is merged here.
- **`develop`**: The integration branch for features and bug fixes. This reflects the latest development state.

### Supporting Branches
- **Feature branches**:
  - Naming: `feature/<feature-name>` (e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication`)
  - Purpose: For developing new features or enhancements.
  - Created from: `develop`
  - Merged into: `develop`
- **Bugfix branches**:
  - Naming: `bugfix/<issue-id>-<description>` (e.g., `bugfix/123-login-error`)
  - Purpose: For fixing bugs in the codebase.
  - Created from: `develop`
  - Merged into: `develop`
- **Hotfix branches**:
  - Naming: `hotfix/<issue-id>-<description>` (e.g., `hotfix/456-critical-bug`)
  - Purpose: For urgent fixes to production issues.
  - Created from: `main`
  - Merged into: `main` and `develop`
- **Release branches**:
  - Naming: `release/<version>` (e.g., `release/1.0.0`)
  - Purpose: For preparing a release with final tweaks and documentation.
  - Created from: `develop`
  - Merged into: `main` and `develop`

## 2. Branching Workflow

### Creating a Branch
1. Start from the appropriate base branch (`develop` for features/bugfixes, `main` for hotfixes).
2. Create a branch with a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git checkout -b feature/add-user-authentication
   ```
3. Work on your changes, committing frequently with clear messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add user authentication endpoint"
   ```

### Merging Changes
1. Push your branch to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/add-user-authentication
   ```
2. Create a pull request (PR) to merge into the target branch (`develop` or `main`).
3. Ensure the PR includes:
   - A clear title (e.g., "Add user authentication feature").
   - A description of changes, purpose, and any relevant issue IDs.
   - Links to related documentation or tests.

## 3. Pull Requests (PRs)

Pull requests are the mechanism for proposing, reviewing, and merging code changes.

### Creating a Pull Request
1. On the repository platform , navigate to the branch.
2. Create a PR targeting the appropriate branch (`develop` for features/bugfixes, `main` for hotfixes).
3. Assign at least two reviewers and link any relevant issues.
4. Ensure automated checks (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, tests) pass.

### PR Guidelines
- **Keep PRs small**: Focus on a single feature or bugfix to simplify reviews.
- **Clear descriptions**: Explain what the PR does, why it’s needed, and how to test it.
- **Include tests**: Add unit or integration tests to validate changes.
- **Update documentation**: Modify README, API docs, or other relevant files as needed.

## 4. Code Reviews

Code reviews ensure code quality, consistency, and adherence to standards.

### Reviewer Responsibilities
1. **Check functionality**: Verify the code works as intended and meets requirements.
2. **Code quality**:
   - Ensure readability, proper naming, and adherence to style guides.
   - Check for edge cases and error handling.
3. **Tests**: Confirm that tests are included and cover the changes adequately.
4. **Security**: Look for potential vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, improper input validation).
5. **Performance**: Identify any obvious performance issues.

### Review Process
1. Reviewers provide feedback within 24-48 hours to avoid delays.
2. Use constructive comments, suggesting improvements or asking clarifying questions.
3. Approve the PR once all feedback is addressed and checks pass.
4. The PR author resolves comments and makes necessary changes.

### Best Practices
- **Be respectful**: Provide feedback constructively and avoid personal critiques.
- **Be thorough but efficient**: Focus on critical issues while avoiding nitpicking.
- **Automate where possible**: Use linters and static analysis tools to catch common issues.

## 5. Example Workflow

### Scenario: Adding a New Feature
1. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git checkout -b feature/add-user-authentication
   ```
2. Develop the feature, commit changes, and push:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Implement user login endpoint"
   git push origin feature/add-user-authentication
   ```
3. Create a PR targeting `develop` with a description:
   ```
   Title: Add user authentication feature
   Description: Implements login and signup endpoints. Includes unit tests and updated API docs. Resolves issue #123.
   ```
4. Reviewers provide feedback, e.g., "Add input validation for passwords."
5. Address feedback, update the branch, and push changes.
6. Once approved, merge the PR into `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git merge feature/add-user-authentication
   ```
7. Delete the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/add-user-authentication
   git push origin --delete feature/add-user-authentication
   ```

### Scenario: Hotfix
1. Create a hotfix branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b hotfix/456-critical-bug
   ```
2. Fix the issue, commit, and push:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix critical login bug"
   git push origin hotfix/456-critical-bug
   ```
3. Create a PR targeting `main` and another for `develop`.
4. After reviews and approval, merge into both `main` and `develop`.
5. Tag the release in `main` if necessary:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.1
   git push origin v1.0.1
   ```

## 6. Tools and Automation
- **CI/CD**: Use tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins to run tests and linters on every PR.
- **Linters**: Enforce coding standards with tools like ESLint (JavaScript), flake8 (Python), or RuboCop (Ruby).
- **Branch protection**: Enable branch protection rules to require reviews and passing checks before merging.
- **Code review tools**: Use platform features (e.g., GitHub’s review system) to streamline feedback.

## 7. Best Practices
- **Keep branches short-lived**: Merge and delete feature/bugfix branches promptly.
- **Rebase carefully**: Use rebasing for local cleanup but avoid rewriting shared history.
- **Resolve conflicts promptly**: Communicate with team members to resolve merge conflicts.
- **Document decisions**: Record key decisions in PRs or project documentation for future reference.

This branching strategy promotes collaboration, maintains code quality, and ensures a stable release process.
